# Continuous Integration QuickStart

The `ox_herd` package can be used as a simple, lightweight, continuous
integration server to automatically test all of your pull requests on
github. To set things up, do the following:

  1. Define the following environment variables:
     - `GITHUB_USER`: Name of the user that Ox Herd will use to access github.
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Password or personal access token to access github.
     - `GITHUB_SECRET`: A secret string that the github webhook will
        use to authenticate to your server (more on this below).
  2. 

`docker-compose up`

set git webhook to http (or https if you use ssl)

FIXME: make ticket/issue to update pytest junitxml parsing to pytest
version 3 and also update requirements.txt file for that 

      - `OX_WEB_USER`: Name of the user you will use to view and
         interact with the continuous integration server. Technically,
         you can get by with this but it is helpful.

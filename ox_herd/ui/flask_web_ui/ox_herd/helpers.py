First setup basic boiler-plate imports

>>> import random, time
>>> from redis import Redis
>>> from rq import SimpleWorker, Queue
>>> from ox_herd.ui.flask_web_ui.ox_herd import helpers

Next setup the RQDoc to check health along with queues and workers.

>>> doc = helpers.RQDoc()
>>> qname = 'test_q_%i' % random.randint(0, 100000)
>>> queue = Queue(connection=Redis(), name=qname)
>>> worker = SimpleWorker([queue], connection=queue.connection)

Note that we have not started worker yet so calling check method
will return an exception for our named queue since it has no
running workers.

>>> try:  # verify that we get exception if worker not running
...     doc.check(1, qname)
... except ValueError as problem:
...     print('got problem: %s' % str(problem)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
...
got problem: No workers found for queue "test_q_..."

Now we create and queue the doc.check_workers function into the queue.
This is basically just a hack so that when we run the worker in burst
mode the job will get run while the worker is active. We could also
do a potentially cleaner version of this test using threading or
subprocess to have the worker running in the background while we
check that it is alive, but this is a simpler test.

>>> job = queue.enqueue(doc.check_workers, qname)
>>> sdict = {}
>>> probe = doc.launch_probe(1, qname, sdict)
>>> worker.work(burst=True) # verify that doing check with running worker
True
>>> job.result              # is fine with no exception
'OK'
>>> job.get_status()
'finished'
>>> time.sleep(3)
>>> sdict
{'status': 'good'}

Now we are going to verify that the probe will detect a stuck queue.
We enqueue a job that just sleeps to block the queue and then we launch
a quick probe and verify that things look bad.

>>> sjob = queue.enqueue(time.sleep, 3)
>>> sdict = {}
>>> probe = doc.launch_probe(1, qname, sdict)
>>> worker.work(burst=True) # verify that doing check with running worker
True
>>> time.sleep(5)
>>> sdict
{'status': 'bad'}
